\f0\fs26 \cf0 - Paint a picture of a different kind of clinical medicine: proactive, where a patient is contacted by a physician, the physician reads the signs of their illness, does not need to wait for the illness to "reveal itself" (ref Osler), can confidently recommend behavior changes and works actively to change the environment to create a setting where well-being is possible. \
