One could envision a world where a person arrives at the physician with a complaint and the physician prescribes changes in lifestyle, is able to identify the early precursors of more serious disease, suggests how to change one's life or environment to avoid disease.

# A vision of medicine as it might be
- Paint a picture of a different kind of clinical medicine: proactive, where a patient is contacted by a physician, the physician reads the signs of their illness, does not need to wait for the illness to "reveal itself" (ref Osler), can confidently recommend behavior changes and works actively to change the environment to create a setting where well-being is possible. 
- Note that this is no less scientific than clinical medicine today: but why don't we know these things? 

# Medicine as myth
- Asclepius and Hygieia living as father and daughter, depicted together. 

# The ecology of medical evidence
- Enlightenment driving a wedge between them. 
- Science is a powerful tool, but it too is subject to the laws of evolution - finding easier progress in some routes rather than in others. If science feeds on empirical truth, not all empirical truths are created equally: in some, the nutrients are easier to access, providing fertile ground where science can progress rapidly, sped along by the simple sugars of apparent causes and effects. In others, perhaps a more lasting nutrition is based on harder truths. Science is unhealthy as it has been nourished almost exclusively on the easily accessible truths, and as goes science, so goes humanity. (An ecology of science!). 
  - A deep link between knowledge and health - how long has this been understood? But the type of knowledge dictates the type of health. Not all knowledge is equal, or equally accessible; and so the shape of our knowledge dictates the shape of our health. 
- Science more easily reveals causal chains that are immediate and apparent. This favors acute medicine. It leaves an entire discipline, a full class of questions, obscure. What is this class? Who suffers most from this class of problems? 
- A science of un-happening. Just as clinical medicine sees the dead as its ideal, scientific medicine as it is currently concieved needs disease to justify its existence. (Maybe note vaccine trials - it's difficult to demonstrate efficacy when an epidemic is on the way down). 
  - vaccination as strengthening the glass (and also removing rocks!) - but if it is successful, it is harder to demonstrate its success. 
  - same with sanitation, nutrition. Need to pin down this argument better. 
- Concept of Medicine: improvements in well-being have been mis-attributed to scientific medicine. 
- Ryle, the Concept of Mind: the metaphor of the glass. There are different causal statements, one active and one dispositional (the glass broke because the rock hit it; the glass broke because it was brittle). These reveal at least three ways of intervening: detect and intercept the rock, or lessen the rate of its impact; strengthen the glass; reduce the number of rocks in the world. 
- Clinical medicine is involved with detecting and intercepting the rock. Why? What makes this sort of causal element easier to know than the others? Dig into causal inference for this... 

# Re-establishing Hygieia's place in medicine 
- Note some of this has been wilful, related to power, negligence, lack of concern. Beneath all of that, however, is also an epistemic issue. Without addressing this issue, none of those others can be addressed in turn. 
- The snake represents wisdom, well-being, resilience. Asclepius listens to the snake, deriving from the principles of well-being how to bring a patient back from the brink of the grave. Hygieia takes a different approach: nourishing well-being itself. 

Foucault tells us that the dead body is the reference point of clinical medicine, the gravitational center around which medical knowledge orbits and from which it derives its meaning.

What sorts of events is the scientific method best suited to describe? 
- Discrete/concrete/time-limited causes
  - Note that active causes are more likely to be simple causes; dispositional causes are more likely to be complex causes. 
- Effects that closely follow temporally 
- Effects that are apparent/large 
- Effects that are consistent 
- 

Which areas of knowledge are less accessible due to these challenges? 
- ???
