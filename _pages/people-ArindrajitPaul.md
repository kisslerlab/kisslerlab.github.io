## Bio 

My name is Arindrajit Paul, and I am a first-year MS student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

My research goals broadly encompass the utilization of artificial intelligence in public health to improve access to universal healthcare. I love working with large datasets, and currently I am working with Dr Stephen Kissler to get a better understanding of the mathematical foundations of modelling infectious disease outbreaks and how to handle them.

In my free time, I like to make music and take photos of nature. I also love experimenting with recipes and enjoy long sessions of action RPGs (my current obsession is Diablo 4).
