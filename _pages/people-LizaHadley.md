## Bio 

Hi all, I'm Liza - a postdoctoral researcher jointly affiliated to CU Boulder and the University of Cambridge. My research explores the role of infectious disease modelling in international outbreak response. I am interested in how mathematical modelling is used by governments, health organisations, and other policy actors during a health crisis, and whether these processes can be improved. Our recent study interviewed modellers, science advisors, policy makers, and decision makers across 13 different countries to produce an evidence base for the use and translation of modelling in Covid-19 response. I am now developing this area of research further. Additionally, I provide mathematical modelling support for key vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Recent examples include informing MenACWY vaccination strategy by investigating the expected impact of Covid-19 disruption to meningococcal meningitis in the UK, and supporting the World Health Organization's Meningitis Roadmap by examining optimal outbreak control strategies for pneumococcal meningitis in the African Meningitis Belt.

Outside of academics, I'm super into gymnastics and also enjoy other casual sports from time to time - salsa dancing, skating, hiking, and (beginner) skiing. Very much against any team sport involving a projectile or something I'm supposed to dodge. Also enjoy sewing, baking, and eating said baking!

## Background

Prior to joining CU, I studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford, worked as a Research Assistant at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and then completed a PhD in outbreak modelling and policy at the University of Cambridge. I'm excited to be spending slightly more time on the other side of the pond now with my new role in Boulder!
