## Bio 

My name is Nour Rahal-Arabi and I am a first year MS student in the Computer Science department here at CU Boulder.

I have always had a keen interest in the intersection of computer science and medicine, biology, and the natural sciences. I believe that mathematical and technological advancements have the potential to make a profound and positive impact on the methodologies, practices and policies surrounding public health. My current research is centered around creating large scale transmission models for simulating the spread of disease, seeking to draw conclusions surrounding vaccination priority populations and public policy.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State University in 2023, during which I used mathematical and machine learning-based methods to model coastal species behavior and other ecological dynamics.

I currently serve as the Treasurer of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association (CSGSA). In my spare time, you'll find me skiing, hiking, rock climbing, and cooking.
