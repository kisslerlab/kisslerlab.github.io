## Welcome! <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Mission, expectations, and values <!-- ---------------------------------- -->

### Our mission

### Academic integrity 

### Equity and Justice

### My expectations of lab members

### My pledge to lab members 

## Lab life <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Meetings 

- __One-on-ones__: I meet with new graduate students (during their first year) and new postdocs (during their first three months) weekly. After that period, it's up to the student/postdoc whether they'd like to continue meeting weekly or if they'd prefer to transition to every other week. Please send a brief agenda before each meeting (via Slack) to keep us on track. Meetings are 45 minutes, so that I can use the last 15 minutes to jot down notes about our conversation, send follow-up emails, and prep for the next meeting. The time is yours: I expect to spend most of our time talking about research, but feel free to bring up other career- and life-related things too! 

- __Lab meetings:__ Once our lab reaches a critical mass, we'll begin having weekly lab meetings. These meetings will be research-focused and oriented towards workshoping projects that are ongoing. Each week, a different lab member will present. The aim is for them to be maximally useful to the presenter. The meetings will last for an hour (we'll do everything we can to not exceed that), and it's up to the presenter to decide how best to balance between formal presentation and discussion/questions. 

- __Research practice meetings:__ Once per rotation, we'll replace one lab meeting with a "research practice" meeting. At each of these meetings, we'll discuss a different topic related to various tasks of doing science, such as making presentations, writing manuscripts, using LaTeX, formulating compartmental epidemiological models, and so on. I'll begin by giving a brief introduction to the topic and then we'll open up to a discussion where lab members can share tips and tricks they've learned along the way. 

- __Social justice meetings:__ Once per rotation, we'll also replace one lab meeting with a "social justice" meeting, since health is about more than just disease, and more than just modeling. At these meetings, we'll discuss a reading (to be chosen by lab members) that helps us to think more deeply about our citizenship in the lab, university, and our larger communities. Readings may focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, political advocacy, community service, and related topics. They should help us think imaginatively about concrete positive changes we can make to improve the lives of those around us. 

### Working hours
- I expect lab members (including myself) to be semi-responsive electronically between 10am-4pm on work days (don't worry, I won't be timing your response time – just try not to be totally checked out). 
- I also expect lab members (again, myself included) to be physically in lab at least three days per week – the more the better! 

### Communication
- Outside of meetings, most of our lab communication will happen on Slack. Please check Slack regularly, and let me know if you have any difficulties with using it! 
- Our lab directory, meeting calendar, and vacation logs will be housed on Google Drive. 
- I will periodically send emails, especially when forwarding information that I first received via email. 
- Virtual meetings will happen on Zoom. 

I'll do my best to limit our communication to these channels to avoid things getting overly complicated. 

### Social activities

Periodically, we'll do fun things that aren't related to modeling and diseases, like hikes, meals, and pub trips. We'll do our best to make these accessible to everyone. These activities are __not__ mandatory, and while I'd love for everyone to join, I recognize that people have other responsibilities, which may include simply taking some time at home to stare at a wall. That's ok, I need that sometimes too. If for any reason you feel like you're being excluded from social events, come talk to me and we'll make a change. 

### Retreats

Once per year, we'll go on a lab retreat. Unlike social activities, this is something that everyone should make an effort to attend. These will be day-long, off-campus events during the work week where we have a bit of time for fun and a bit of time for science. The science portion will involve celebrating achievements over the past year, listing ongoing projects, and dreaming up new things for us to work on. We'll also take some time to discuss lab culture and raise anything that needs to be changed. 

### Vacation
In my experience, when trainees are told to take vacation on an as-needed basis "as long as they're getting their work done", it means that... they never take vacation, and when they do, they feel super stressed about how they should be working instead. I want you to take vacations (please!), and I want you to enjoy them. Toward that end, you've got 15 vacation days per year, in addition to weekends and school-sanctioned holidays, to use as you see fit, no questions asked. I'd appreciate if you let me and any other collaborators know when you'll be away with some advance notice so that we can plan ahead, but no need to justify, and no need to tell me your plans (though I'd personally love to hear about whatever fun things you get up to!). Log your days on the Google Docs sheet, and do your best to use them all! If you end up needing more, let's have a chat and I'm sure we'll find a good way forward. 

### Sick days
We're a lab that studies infectious diseases, so if you've got an infectious disease, or anything else for that matter, please stay home, and please rest. These don't count toward your vacation days, and there's no need to log them - it's on an honor basis. 

<!-- ### Checkpoints -->

### Personal development plans
Every six months, I'll devote a one-on-one meeting to discuss progress, short-term goals, and long-term aspirations with lab members. I ask each lab member to fill out a short reflection prior to these meetings to make sure we get the most out of our time. Like our regular one-on-ones, this is your time, so let me know how I can be of most use to you! 


## Research best practice <!-- --------------------------------------------- -->

### Open science 
I am a firm believer in making scientific discovery accessible to all. Our code is posted on public repositories on Github and our manuscripts are posted on preprint servers to ensure the widest possible access. If at any time you feel like I'm not living up to this ideal, let me know and I'll make a change. 

### Writing code
Open code is one key part of conducting open science. Github is our lab's tool of choice for achieving this. It's ok to keep your code repositories private while they're under construction, but I encourage everyone to make their full version histories public once a project is submitted for publication. It's helpful to keep this in mind from the start! See [Guidance for developing code](/handbook-codeguidance.md) for more detailed information.

### Documenting research
We need our science to be reproducible, which means ensuring that lab work is sufficiently documented for members of the group to hand off projects to one another when necessary. Toward this end, each member of the lab will have a personal repository on Github where they'll keep a running lab notebook. You can include as much in this notebook as you like, but at a minimum it should include enough information to re-create your thought process as you worked through various research problems. See the [Guidance for developing code](/handbook-codeguidance.md) for pointers on how to set up an online lab notebook on Github using Markdown. 

### Writing manuscripts 
Good scientific writing is as important as the science itself. I strongly encourage lab members to start writing as early as possible, since writing often helps to clarify thoughts and highlight key gaps in a project. I expect trainees to supply a fleshed-out first draft on their own, after which we can iterate back and forth with edits and revisions. I am competent with LaTeX (Overleaf is especially good), Microsoft Word, and Google Docs; feel free to pick whichever one is most suitable to your project and your skills. I'm a big fan of the IMRAD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) – please, no results immediately following the introduction. I've collected some pointers on writing good scientific prose on the [Guidance for writing manuscripts](/handbook-manuscriptguidance.md) page. 

### Giving presentations 
Presentations are a key part of scientific communication. I aim to give lab members ample opportunities to present their work to a variety of audiences. Internal talks need not be especially polished, but external ones should be. See the page on [Guidance for giving presentations](/handbook-presentationguidance.md) for more info. 

### Public engagement
I strongly support taking opportunities to share research with the broader community. This might include giving presentations to high school groups, hosting science fairs for elementary kids, or writing popular science articles. Beyond research, I also strongly support lab members taking time to serve the community in ways that complement our research aims, like volunteering to help distribute information about vaccination clinics and advocating for public health reform. Our primary aim as a lab is to conduct good research, but feel free to devote some of your "work hours" to these aims too. 

## Physical resources <!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

### High-performance computing
See the OIT's [page on research computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/){:target="_blank"} for guidance on using the heavy-duty machinery. 

### Lab space
Lab members will have a dedicated desk on the first floor of the Engineering Center. Due to the odd configuration of the engineering center, my office is across the common area in a separate wing of the Engineering Center, but I'll aim to stop by the lab space twice a day. Feel free to come knock on my door anytime and I'll brew you a fresh cup of coffee or tea.
