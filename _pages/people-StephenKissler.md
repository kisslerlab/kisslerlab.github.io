## About

I've always loved building models. When I found out in college that you can build models using math, I never looked back. I studied Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder (BS/MS 2014) with an empahsis in biochemsitry and mathematical biology. I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics as a Gates Scholar at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Julia Gog, where I studied the geographic and demographic transmission patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. I worked for three years as a postdoctoral fellow with Yonatan Grad at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health where I mainly focused on COVID-19 response. I've now returned to Colorado to help build up CU's offerings in computational epidemiology. 

Outside of research, I play the violin and whatever else I can get my hands on, I build and ride bikes, and I get unreasonably excited about good coffee and good short fiction. 

I keep some rough-hewn essays on epidemiological modeling [here](/people/StephenKissler/posts).
