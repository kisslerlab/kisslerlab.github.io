## Bio 

My name is Maia Richards-Dinger (she/her) and I am a current PhD student in the Applied Mathematics department at CU Boulder.

I earned a BA at Lewis and Clark College, where I majored in Math and Biology and was first exposed to (and intrigued by!) the idea of using math to model disease through a project on the basic SIR model in my Differential Equations class. I then attended Western Washington University to earn my MS in Math, where I studied models of epidemics on networks. As a PhD student, I continue to be interested in epidemiological modeling and tracing disease networks with the goal of improving human health and health systems. My work in Stephenâ€™s lab currently focuses on flu forecasting using climate and population data, as well as designing forecasting competitions.


Outside of math, I love spending time with my girlfriend and our two cats Coho and Silvie. I also am an avid knitter, ultramarathoner, and outdoor recreation enthusiast.
