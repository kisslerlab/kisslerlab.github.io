## Bio 

My name is Carolyn Fulton and I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

As a researcher, I seek to establish mathematical toolsets to improve understanding and discover relationships within complex biological systems. My aim is to provide real world impact by translating such findings towards more robust medical practices and policies. Particular areas of interest of mine include (but are not limited to) circadian rhythms, neuroscience, genomics, epidemiology, cancer biology and cardiology through the lenses of personalized medicine, public health and medical device/treatment optimization. I am currently the President of the Association for Women in Mathematics Chapter at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Prior to Colorado, I earned my Bachelors in Science with Honors in Mathematics and a minor in Biology from Schreiner University in Kerrville, Texas. I played NCAA DIII softball all four years during which I was nominated team captain for the 2020-2021 season and received NFCA Academic All American awards. 

Outside academics I enjoy watching and playing sports such as volleyball, basketball, soccer, and slow pitch softball. I really enjoy hiking, snowboarding and swimming outdoors when I can and eating lots of international foods.
