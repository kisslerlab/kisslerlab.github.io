<!-- - Note on preferences in different fields, and how we mainly write for medical and public health journals, sometimes computational biology (but usually the medical format works best) 
- Background/motivation for IMRAD - note it's a strict formula, but this actually helps creativity rather than hindering it. 
- Use past tense! 
- Active voice 
- Simple words 
- One idea per sentence. 
- Sentence structure (first and last words matter; choose last words to lead into next sentence)
- Paper should be interpretable by reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. 

- Reference managers 
- Writing tools (Scrivener, Scapple, Markdown, Word, Overleaf)
