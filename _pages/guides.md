title: "Guides for the Perplexed"
---

These pages offer guidance for conducting common scientific and computational tasks, essential for the running of our lab. They are written from my (Stephen's) perspective, based on personal experience and whatever research I've been able to do. These are therefore not the "right" way to do things, but rather are my attempt to highlight which things have worked especially well for me and which other things haven't, to hopefully make others' journey through academic science a little smoother.
